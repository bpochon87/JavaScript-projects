# JavaScript Projects

One JS project is included in this repo (Calculator) while the other two are in two-separate repos but are linked below.
They include:
<ul>
  <li>Pizza Menu</li>
  <li>Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
  <li>Calculator</li>
</ul>
  
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bpochon87/Pizza_Project" target="_blank">Pizza Menu</a></h3>
Here a menu was created with many different topping options for ordering a pizza. After taking user input, a total cost is calculated. I salivated during the making of this project.
  
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bpochon87/TicTacToe" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe</a></h3>
Tic-Tac-Toe was recreated with cat heads, kitten noises, and win or tie sound effects. User plays against the computer where its choices are randomly generated.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/bpochon87/JavaScript-projects/tree/main/Basic_JavaScript_Projects/Calculator" target="_blank">Calculator</a></h3>
A simple calculator with four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
